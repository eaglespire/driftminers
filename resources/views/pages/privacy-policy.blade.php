                                Consent. For some processing activities, we require your prior consent. This applies for example to some of our direct marketing activities which fall under the scope of the GDPR. You will always be prompted to take clear, affirmative action so that we can ensure that you agree with the processing of your Personal Data. This action may, for example, take the form of a checkbox. If you have given us your consent for processing operations, you may always change your mind, and withdraw your consent at any time and easily; all you need to do is to send us an email at the following address support@driftminers.com
                                Performance of a contract. Some Personal Data we process about you is for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with us.

                                In most cases where we process Personal Data in the context of our Services we rely on our legitimate interests in
                                conducting our normal business as a legal basis for such processing. Our legitimate interests are to identify or prevent
                                fraud, to enhance the security of our network and information systems, or to carry out processing operations for
                                statistical purposes. We will use legitimate interest only when we have carried out an assessment on the impact that
                                this processing may have on you, and concluded that the processing does not unduly infringe your rights and freedoms.
                                For example, we do not use this justification if we process sensitive data, or when the processing would be unexpected
                                for you, or if we consider it to be too intrusive.
